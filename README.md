# Malware-Detection-ML

Malware is one of the most common cyberattacks, and its prevalence continues to increase daily across various networks. Unlike benign traffic, which tends to be symmetrical, malware traffic is characteristically asymmetrical. This distinct pattern is one of the key indicators used to identify malicious activities within a network. The rising occurrence of malware poses significant challenges to cybersecurity, making it imperative to develop robust detection and prevention mechanisms.

The network traffic of a virtual machine on a Unix/Linux-based platform was used to build this dataset. The dataset includes the harmless actions of malware software for Android devices. It consists of 35 attributes (features) and 100,000 records (50,000 malware records and 50,000 benign ones). The dataset was created for classification and malware detection purposes and is available on the [Kaggle site](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nsaravana/malware-detection?select=Malware+dataset.csv).

For the preprocessing part, I used the Interquartile Range (IQR) method for outlier removal and feature selection based on highly correlated feature removal. To address class imbalance after preprocessing, I used the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). All the classifiers except Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB) showed perfect scores, indicating potential overfitting. By focusing on BernoulliNB and improving the accuracy from 71% to 87% using GridSearchCV, I was able to create a robust model. Finally, I developed a Streamlit UI to make the model accessible and user-friendly.
